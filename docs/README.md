# API Documentation
The rConsole API consists of two different APIs
- TCP Sockets
- HTTP

The HTTP API is the most feature rich, and is ment for most people. The TCP sockets api is lacking most features, and is only ment for applications where HTTP is not possible

**TCP Socket API**: [docs](TCP.md)  
**HTTP API**: [docs](http/README.md)
